##What is PDFObject?

PDFObject is a lightweight JavaScript library for dynamically embedding PDFs in HTML documents. It allows users to use their native PDF viewers if they have them, but if not, the script will use [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).

The purpose of the fork is:

- [x] To fix bugs the author refused to fix
- [ ] To add [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) support when the script fails
- [ ] To maintain support of older browsers after the PDFObject v2 changes
- [ ] Enable WebTorrent support of PDFs

Modeled after SWFObject.
